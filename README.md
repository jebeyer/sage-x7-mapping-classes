To run code locally, download files to a folder on your computer. In a terminal, change your directory to that folder and run sage. 

At the sage prompt, for example, type ```load("hyperelliptic.sage")``` to run the hyperelliptic involution script. Replace the file name in the command to run a different script. 

```load("x7-setup.sage")``` is called by each of the other scripts. There is no need to load x7-setup.sage separately unless you want to use the defined functions from the sage prompt or in your own script.
